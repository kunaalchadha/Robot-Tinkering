# Robot-Tinkering
Opensource workflows to communicate with KUKA (KRC2/4) and Universal Robots in realtime through grasshopper. The workflows have been tested and developed at Institute of Advanced Architecture for Catalonia (IAAC) in Barcelona.


****KUKA robots using KUKAVARPROXY****
This workflow has been integrated into the grasshopper environment based on the precedent work done by ([https://github.com/ImtsSrl/KUKAVARPROXY] (url)). It works on accessing global variables on the KRC side using KUKAVARPROXY as a bridge over TCP/IP. This workflow has been tested on KRC2 and KRC4 controllers.


****Universal Robots using ****

The following is a rework on the example file provided by Universal Robots for E series using Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) library([https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/ur/interface-communication/real-time-data-exchange-rtde-guide/](url))
